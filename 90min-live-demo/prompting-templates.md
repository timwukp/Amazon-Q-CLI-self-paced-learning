# Advanced Prompting Templates for Amazon Q CLI Demo

**Structured prompting patterns for consistent, high-quality demonstrations**

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide provides the specific prompting templates and patterns used in the 90-minute Amazon Q CLI demonstration, designed for principal engineers familiar with Cursor, GitLab, and GCP.

## ðŸ§  Global Prompting Rules

These rules are applied consistently throughout the demonstration:

### Rule 1: Context-Aware Prompting
```bash
# Pattern
"Given my current [CONTEXT] and [ENVIRONMENT], [specific request]"

# Examples
"Given my current GCP Cloud Functions setup and GitLab CI/CD workflows, create equivalent AWS Lambda architecture"
"Given my current project structure and AWS environment, optimize my deployment pipeline"
```

### Rule 2: Role-Based Prompting
```bash
# Pattern
"As a [ROLE] with [EXPERTISE], [action] considering [CONSTRAINTS]"

# Examples
"As a principal engineer familiar with GCP, design AWS architecture considering our team's current expertise"
"As a senior software engineer, refactor this code considering security, performance, and maintainability"
```

### Rule 3: Constraint-Driven Prompting
```bash
# Pattern
"[Request] with the following constraints: [CONSTRAINT1], [CONSTRAINT2], [CONSTRAINT3]"

# Examples
"Create serverless API with constraints: budget under $200/month, sub-200ms response time, GDPR compliant"
"Deploy application with constraints: maintain GitLab workflows, zero downtime, multi-region support"
```

### Rule 4: Multi-Step Prompting
```bash
# Pattern
"First analyze [X], then recommend [Y], finally implement [Z] with [CONSIDERATIONS]"

# Examples
"First analyze my GCP usage patterns, then recommend AWS equivalents, finally implement migration strategy with cost optimization"
"First review security implications, then suggest improvements, finally generate implementation with proper error handling"
```
